# Python Snake ReadMe

Name: Snake
Version: 0.0.1.0
Contributors: Oluwakemi Toluwalase


Simple Snake game used for educational purposes.

Description
This started as a project to build a simple game using Python. As I learn more, I will improve the application, and now its just something to fool around with. After finding GitHub, this was the only "useful" project to upload as to test out GitHub. I plan to improve it where I can.

Changelog
1.0
Added ability to read from file.
First attempt to Snake!
